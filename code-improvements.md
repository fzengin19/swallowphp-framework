# Code Improvement Analysis

## Initial Findings and Recommendations

### Auth Class Improvements

1. Password Security:
   - Current minimum password length (3) is too short
   - Should enforce password complexity requirements
   - Consider adding password hashing options configuration

2. Authentication:
   - Add rate limiting for login attempts
   - Implement session timeout
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Sanitize user input

3. Cookie Security:
   - Add secure and httpOnly flags
   - Implement token rotation
   - Add cookie encryption

### Cache Class Improvements

1. File Cache:
   - Add directory permissions checks
   - Implement file locking for concurrent access
   - Add cache size limits
   - Improve error handling for file operations

2. SQLite Cache:
   - Add connection pooling
   - Implement prepared statements consistently
   - Add error logging
   - Add cache cleanup mechanism

Next steps will include implementing these improvements while maintaining the existing API surface.
